/* This is an in-place comparison-based sorting algorithm. Here, a sub-list is maintained which is always sorted. For example, the lower part of an array is maintained to be sorted. An element which is to be 'insert'ed in this sorted sub-list, has to find its appropriate place and then it has to be inserted there. Hence the name, insertion sort.

The array is searched sequentially and unsorted items are moved and inserted into the sorted sub-list (in the same array). This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case complexity are of O(nÂ²), where n is the number of items.

insertion sort provides several advantages:

Simple implementation: Jon Bentley shows a three-line C version, and a five-line optimized version[1]
Efficient for (quite) small data sets, much like other quadratic sorting algorithms
More efficient in practice than most other simple quadratic (i.e., O(n2)) algorithms such as selection sort or bubble sort
Adaptive, i.e., efficient for data sets that are already substantially sorted: the time complexity is O(kn) when each element in the input is no more than k places away from its sorted position
Stable; i.e., does not change the relative order of elements with equal keys
In-place; i.e., only requires a constant amount O(1) of additional memory space
Online; i.e., can sort a list as it receives it */
